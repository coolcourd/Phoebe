Courd and I have been married almost 9 years.  We’ve been trying to get pregnant for a couple years now, maybe longer I ‘ve lost count.  We haven’t been able to get pregnant.  I’ve been praying and praying that God would tell us what we are supposed to be doing during this time without kids.  Should we continue trying naturally? Go through fertility treatments? Adopt? Foster?  I felt like I wasn’t getting any definitive answers from Him.  About a month ago, I was on my knees praying.  I prayed that if we were to start our family through adoption that something would just fall into our laps.

Fast forward to Friday April 08, 2022.  That morning I was talking to my Dad and he asked if we had ever considered adopting.  I told him we had but haven’t seriously decided to move forward with it.

Fast forward to the night of Friday April 08, 2022.  Courd’s Mom calls us to ask if we have ever considered adopting, like within the next few days, because there is a family friend who is at the hospital almost ready to deliver.  They are planning to give their baby up for adoption and want it to go to a good home.  Courd’s mom tells us to think about it for a few minutes and call her back.  This was the sign I prayed for so it only seemed right to move forward with adopting.
Baby girl was born on Sunday April 10, 2022.

Wednesday April 13, 2022 we were at the hospital meeting baby.  She was born 7 weeks early and spending time in the NICU. 

We literally have become instant parents and we are thrilled!  It took us a week to come up with a name and we have absolutely nothing at home for Phoebe because this was so unexpected.  But the outpouring of love we’ve received from our family, our friends, and our ward family at church as been overwhelming.  Everyone seems so excited to see us become parents.  We’ve received calls and texts, left and right asking what Phoebe needs. 
There have been so many small miracles that have fallen into place to make this thing happen, it is amazing.  We are blessed and we’ve seen the Lord’s hand every step of the way.  We pray Phoebe will grow big and strong so she can eventually come home with us.  But for now, we are enjoying every chance we get to just spend with her at the hospital.

I wish I could document every single small miracle that went into making this happen but I’m sure there are so many I’m not even aware of.  We know that there are angels in Heaven that have helped this all work out and are watching over Phoebe.  She probably just said goodbye to them when she came into this world.  We have a few more steps to take before Phoebe is officially ours but we are excited to adopt her and welcome her into our family.  We can’t wait for her to meet her grandparents, cousins, and aunts/uncles.  This sweet girl is so loved already.
