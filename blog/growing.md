 ​
 
Phoebe's goals are to:

1. Nipple all feeds

2. Sleep

3. Grow

4. Bond with parents
  
 ​And Phoebe is crushing it! We were a little worried because she kept losing weight, but it seems like the 1 week mark changed everything. She was only weighing 4lbs 3.5oz on Sunday. Now she is up to 4lbs 8.9oz

 - Grow ✅ (But keep growing)
 
 
 All last week Phoebe was very hit or miss with her bottle feeding, but the nurse told us that today she bottle fed her entire bottle twice and had been eating well at all feeds. Elizabeth and i both got the chance to feed her again tonight. Phoebe was so good for us and she took her entire bottle for both of us!

  - Nipple all feeds ✅ (we are getting there but a check mark for awesome progress)
  
  Phoebe does great with sleeping. It's important that she's left alone to sleep as much as possible, everything for this seems to be going well. She is sleeping in Elizabeth's arms right now.

  - sleep ✅
  
  We are in love with our girl. We have already attached to her, and I swear she smiled when she first saw us on Easter. We now have 4 stars on our kangaroo! 1 for each hour of skin on skin time. Also, the hotel by the hospital gave us a special deal so we can stay close to her!

  Bond with parents ✅
  
  The nurse we had tonight was great! She was an older lady who was very thoughtful and helpful. She took extra time to teach us and help us understand how to care for our baby in a loving grandmother-like way.
  
  The nurses were joking that it is time to bring her home because of how well she is doing. This gives me hope that the time to bring her home will come sooner than we think. Keep it up Phoebe! You are doing great!
