We got to go see our daughter twice today. The doctor comes by to see all of the babies every day between 9-11, so we took a break from work to finally meet our doctor. We have had some concerns about our baby that the nurses said that we need to talk to the doctor about. Luckily, the doctor was able to tell us that phoebe is healthy, progressing, and doesn't give him any reason to worry about her considering her situation.

Elizabeth changed her first diaper and we were able to comfort Phoebe as the nurse pricked her foot to draw blood. Her cry is so cute... at least for now. I am not convinced that I will still think her cry is cute after a few long nights with her.

The nurse ran some tests and told us that her jaundice is much better and that she will no longer need to be in that blue light blanket. Which is nice because it isn't the softest thing to snuggle.

Speaking of jaundice, I have a Jon dis of my own. Yo! Jon, your feet are too big!

We went back to the hotel to finish out our work day and then drove back to the hospital. Elizabeth tried to feed her a bottle but Phoebe was too sleepy so we fed her with her tube. Elizabeth held her the whole time she ate, and then I took her for more skin time.

Apparently, skin on skin time is also called kangaroo. They have a chart up where each baby gets a kangaroo and you get a sticker for each hour you spend kangaroo with your baby. I didn't post the whole board out of respect to the other's on the board. But some of those other babies sure had a lot of stars on their kangaroos. 

We wrote Phoebe's name on a kangaroo, loaded it with a couple of stars and put in on the board with the others.

Lastly, let me tell you about this kangaroo time. It really is special. I got a full hour with her today. Elizabeth suggested that I sing "my heavenly father loves me" to her. I took the scenic route making my way to that song. I sung her some of the greatest emo rock hits, 21 pilots, and even sang our song to her. ("Smother me" by "The Used") 

Wow, I was not ready for what overcame me. I hadn't cried out loud like that since I was a teenager. The song had always seemed like a song to sing to your other half. But Singing these words to my baby girl really hit hard.

Let me be the one who calls you "baby" all the time

Surely you can take some comfort knowing that you're mine

Just hold me tight

Lay by my side

And let me be the one who calls you "baby" all the time

I found my place in the world

Could stare at your face for the rest of my days

Now I can breathe, turn my insides out

And smother me

Warm and alive, I'm all over you

Would you smother me?

Let me be the one who never leaves you all alone

I hold my breath and lose the feeling that I'm on my own (leaves me all 
alone)

Hold me too tight

Stay by my side

And let me be the one who calls you "baby" all the time (all the time)
