We haven't seen Phoebe for 2 days but we are back and she missed us!  And we missed her! She is chubbier than the last time we saw her. Her face is rounder and her stomach more full.  Her birth-weight was 2300 grams, then she dropped down to 19 something and now she is up to 2240 grams.  Almost back to her birth weight! 

Tonight was Courd's turn to do kangaroo care with her and boy was he excited! In the car on the way here he said "you know what's special about tonight? It's my turn to do kangaroo care with Phoebe!"  He sang her a lullaby (without crying)!  He also took a mini nap with her.

I held her a bit before that and stared at her beautiful pure face straight from heaven.  It is amazing how much we love this beautiful babe when we've only known her for a week and a half.  She didn't spend 9 months in the womb with us.  We literally met her a week and a half ago and have so much love for her. 

We are grateful that our loving Heavenly Father has trusted us to be her parents and we hope we can raise her to be a friend to everyone, always kind, and a follower of Jesus Christ.  She is so pure and innocent right now and I wish she could stay that way forever.

We have been given a couple of preemie outfits already so we brought those to the hospital with us to dress her in.  She also ate her whole bottle for me tonight! 

Tonight was a short visit but we look forward to spending more time with her tomorrow.
