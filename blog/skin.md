Today was a very special day. We woke up in the morning and got a hot breakfast from our hotel's cafeteria. We proceeded to work from the hotel until we decided that it is probably time to take a break, grab lunch, and stop in to see Phoebe while we are at it.

Elizabeth and I are still trying to figure out what to call her, but I am running with Phoebe until she tells me it's something else.
We got to the hospital to find her wrapped in a blue light up blanket.

The blue light is used to help her skin. I learned that lots of times babies skin can get orange and they call it jaundice. Usually it doesnt need to be treated, but it can cause issues if it gets out of hand so they are taking care of it.

To protect Phoebe's eyes, they put a blindfold on her face that Elizabeth loves. It looks like a pair of sun glasses which I have to admit, it's pretty cute. Phoebe of course, doesn't care for it and would prefer to be able to see,

Elizabeth got to hold Phoebe in the big thick blanket for about 10 min before we got a call from our lawyer. She told us that we needed to come in to the office right away to sign our petition for temporary custody. After an hour drive there, a quick signature, and an hour drive back we had some work time to finish up.

At 7:30 the hospital finishes it's shift change and we were able to go see Phoebe again. Now it's bath time! Our nurse taught us how to give her a bath. We were able to take most everything attached to her off of her and get her all clean... Until she started pooping everywhere and we had to call bath time over. At least we know that pooping is a good sign of a healthy baby.

After her bath Phoebe was hungry, and she ate almost all of her meal portion through her bottle. Previously they had struggled to get her to eat 10 ml, but I was able to feed her 35 ml leaving the last 10 to be fed through her nose tube.

we were then told it would be a good chance for skin on skin contact. Elizabeth went first, I could tell it was a very special moment for her. Everything with the adoption has gone so fast, we didn't carry or give birth to this baby. A week ago we knew nothing about this opportunity to adopt. Now we are being called mom and dad and we are meeting this beautiful baby girl for the first couple of times and it feels a little surreal.

When baby is wrapped in a blanket, sitting in a tub and you are afraid to hold her wrong and hurt her it's hard to get to know her. For the first time, Elizabeth got to feel Phoebe's nearly bare body up against her chest. Their hearts were beating an inch apart from each other. Until now Elizabeth hadn't felt like Phoebe was her baby but I can tell that this special time helped break that feeling.

But I too got a turn to feel Phoebe on my chest. I was able to feel her head on my chest, her legs squirming occasionally across my belly and her belly somewhere in between. Holding her this way felt personal, I could feel her spirit singing a song of gratitude to be alive and here with me. 

I had heard Elizabeth tell her several times that she loves her, but I hadn't felt a fatherly attachment yet and had never uttered the words. I had never felt like she was my baby to snuggle and kiss and love. I felt like there was a barrier and that the barrier needs to go! I took a moment to breathe and make myself vulnerable. I allowed myself to embrace love and recognized that Phoebe is going to be most special to me for all eternity. 

I said a prayer in my head to give thanks for the miracle that is this girl. I gave thanks for the opportunity to adopt, The ease of the decision and process so far. I received confirmation that this is my baby and for the first time in probably 7 years tears rolled down my face. I think it's good for your eyes anyway ;)

Around this time, the nurse insisted that we get Phoebe wrapped back in her blue light blanket. It was getting late and I was excited to write these feelings down before getting to bed. I think walking away felt like we were leaving a piece of ourselves behind. I am so excited to see her again tomorrow.
