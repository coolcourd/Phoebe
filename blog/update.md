The weekend came and went way too fast. It is normal for babies to lose weight in their first week of life. But every time we weigh Phoebe she is lighter than the last time. The nurses told us that we really need to make sure she can get as much uninterrupted sleep as she can get. It's hard because we just want to hold her.

On easter morning we went in to see Phoebe. We can hold her while she is eating but we don't want to move her around too much. She was too sleepy for her bottle, so she slept in my still arms as she was fed through her tube.

When she had finished eating, We gave her hugs goodbye knowing that we have already checked out of the hotel and we were going home for Easter. 

As we were leaving, the doctor came in so we decided to stick around a while longer. He suggested that we move phoebe to a heartier formula to encourage growth. He said that newborns will usually struggle with the heavier formula, but Phoebe is a week old now so we will try it.

It has been amazing to spend easter with our family. We have loved being Home. We missed our sweet dog Lucy but now it feels like we are missing our baby girl.

I called the hospital monday afternoon and the nurse said that Phoebe is doing great and has even gained 13 grams of weight. The newer formula might be working after all. 

We still have a few things to get figured out around the house to prepare for our girl to come home, but we can hardly wait to see Phoebe again.
